    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>
        I was born nad raised in a small town south of Morgan Hill in California. It was nothing special exept for the quiet areas in he town. I went to the local elementary school then went to a charter school in Morgan Hill which I enjoyed very much.
        </p>
        <h2>What I do Now</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently a founding high school student at Alpha: Cindy Avitia High School in San Jose. It's not very exciting at the school besides the different way they teach here. I've had to take a large break from playing my favorite sport, Lacrosse, because I'm hoping to keep school work as my top priority above anything else. Before, I used to play as goalie for the local team and it was the position choice I've made.
